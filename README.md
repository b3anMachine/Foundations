# Practice makes perfect #

The purpose of this project is to reference and practice programing foundations. 
The best way to use this project is to attempt to implement the unimplemented abstract methods from the “template” classes into the “practice” classes such that the tests in the main methods print all “true” lines. These methods are implemented in the “reference” classes and the tests are setup so that the unimplemented practice methods are passed through the implemented reference methods i.e. the tests all pass by default.
